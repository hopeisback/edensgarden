      <p style="text-align: center;">The <strong>problem</strong> we solve: Our
        era is of normalized corruption.</p>
      <div style="text-align: left;"><strong>A solution</strong>: In order to
        increase our bargaining power, as customers, donees and citizenss, when
        satisfying our needs, while creating our critical mass that preserves
        the identity of the small groups that make up us, when linking the
        groups budgeting to the individuals movements between those groups, we
        can get <strong><em>liquidly </em></strong>organized in activities
        similar to the acquisition groups of services and products in our

        foundation managers, who can show their abilities and their social
        ambitions. </p>
      <p>From here we are creating<em style="border: 3px solid transparent;
  border-image: linear-gradient(to right, yellow,green,violet);

          decentralized and liquid</em> self organized organizations
        arising in our global Network of Foundations, of which each may
        contribute only to <em><strong>humanitarian solutions based on the
            beneficial movement of people between groups in which they have
            equal power</strong>: </em></p>
      <ul>
        <li>These organizations are structured <em>to <strong>prevent
              corruption</strong></em>, when <em>keeping diversity</em> of <strong>all</strong>
          minorities with the non-voters and the majority, while building their
          <em><strong>critical mass for realizing their need</strong></em>.</li>
        <ul>
          <li>The financing is inclusive and made only proportional, without
            letting any winner to take all, while benefiting not only winners
            but also individuals, minorities and abstention, in and between
            their groups, for their participation, while they are consuming,
            naturally and with low learning curve.</li>
          <ul>
            <li>We believe that,&nbsp; when an economic social system is based
              on the winner takes only its proportional share, the system causes
              attraction based affiliation, whereas when such system is based on
              winner-take-it-all, hate is a conditional feeling in group
              belongingness, which is destructively tested by something like
              "how well do they hates our competitors for being privileged to
              live with us".</li>
          </ul>
          <li>The foundations provide, while consulting for solutions, by having
            in each foundation temporal solution projects and, after the
            incubation period, each project, becoming an external legal body,
            can be&nbsp;<span title="" class=""> <span class="tlid-translation translation"

            they have equal power</b>.
          <ul>
            <li> The HopeIsBack’s board of directors may add solutions to Its 6
              initial solutions being:
              <ul>
                <li>the <a href="#comcomized" target="_top">comcomized
                    agreement</a> of equal ownership (designed to avoid taking
                  over by the huge corporations, while giving a room for
                  cooperating with some "normal" business making)- here are some
                  example of concrete solutions: "connecting people" is
                  something owned by them and not by huge company as facebook,
                  convincing the citizens to participate in green energy
                  campaign as green companies owners or making any
                  bailout/privatization cycle with the citiznes as players
                  instead of the few huge companies, </li>
                <li>the <a href="#LiquidUnin" target="_top">Liquid union model</a>
                  of fair distribution (compared with
                  liquid/delegative-democracy telling how to decide and produce
                  or serve, liquid union is about how to get organized to get
                  and choose between services and products) - <b>An ex:</b> the
                  national citizens payment for tv station can be made for
                  liquid union having projects such as entertainment,
                  investigation, education, culture, art-development, etc, where
                  each of which projects has its channels financed proportional
                  to number of participants in the channel, so that also the
                  voices of minorities and non-voter would be heard too,</li>
                <li>the <a target="_top" href="#Qdolphin">Qdolphin browser</a>,
                  A browser for smart people developed confined providing

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>It is all made for <b>solving</b> problems raised because of
              the exponential increase of movement of products, services,
              capital, money and of information, while blocking people - <b>a
                global problematic phenomenos producing higher passivity or
                aggression and more wars</b>.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>Why liquid? Think of the these 3 qualities of water: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> Transparency - transmitting information to all its parts instantly,
          in a wave;</li>
        <li> Acumulativeness - flowing around obstacles to get together and</li>
        <li> Decentralization (single failure point immunization) - moving some
          (drops) of it do not hunt the rest. </li>
      </ul>
      How to decentralize:
      <ul>
        <li>in each foundation to incubate temporal projects each is liquid
          union or comcomized unit, but only for predefined time and then
          contracting with their form legal body in thier region. </li>
      </ul>
      How to course solidarity in liquid unions:
      <ul>
        <li> by comparing per each project their budget/number-of-participants ,
          then comparing the irregularities (from median or average) of
          projects, then limiting the irregularities, with defining exception by
          the need of the union defined in its policies. </li>
      </ul>
      How to course accountability when hiring manager ceo etc:
      <ul>
        <li> when giving any percentage giving it only some times*cycle after
          the cycle of profit of her/his plan which is to be cheeked by
          accountable trustees while until then he/get only salary. </li>
      </ul>
      <p> Our <b>degentrification</b> projects, as gentrification became the
        first world wide city people issue, will offer 2 steps solutions: </p>
      <ul>
        <li> the first step is of liquid unions of which branches are served by
          lawyers and providing storage places, temporal accommodations, moving
          and sharing staff and information centers for renters and </li>
        <li> the second step, which will be triggered after reaching some
          critical mass of participants being also equal share holders in their
          comcomized units, created for lending the necessary money to create
          guaranties for the renters wishing to buy their apartment by their
          renting payments. </li>
      </ul>
      <p></p>
      <p><b>Rationale:</b> The specialization, as a stand alone value in
        economics, is costly, its efficiency is violent, and its beneficiaries
        for increasingly shorter-terms are in increasingly limited group, while
        this drama of purification processing when increasing value (which is
        wrongly named growth) creates slavery and addictions, it is only good
        for corrupting imperialistic domination over the world's population,
        that can, and will, be <b>liberated</b> by the <b>decentralization and
          diversification</b>, in liquid structuring restricting, such that any
        budget movements is attached to the movements of the corresponding
        people between groups in which they have equal power. </p>
      <p><b><a name="recruting" id="recruting"></a>The hopeisback low cost
          recruiting</b> is distributed by requiters via personal cards,

          while keeping mobility and mutuality of their owners. Specifically
          designed against big monopolizing players or pretenders only
          temporally/partly fulfilling the cause of such units. It is
          implemented by each buyer or seller, which must care for the terms of
          this license, where the minimum damage for any owner’s units is
          reflected by the value of the share of the unit.</p>
        <p>A Common company (ComCom) ownership agreement is an agreement of
          ownership between the&nbsp;company’s owners. The agreement, or the
          qualified majority required to change it, is unchangeable. The
          ownership over any part of the ComCom, including any of its asset, can
          be transferred between its owners only under this license:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Each owner is either an ordinary owner or a peer owner being equal
            to another peer owner and may only be human or a ComCom;</li>
          <li>Through all holding layers, only a single holding position per
            owner is allowed;</li>
          <li>The&nbsp;ComCom has the first right to buy any ownership over
            itself and each of its owners must match its criteria;</li>
          <li>Per each ComCom, all the peers together equally hold (d) times 100

            <p><strong>Notes:</strong></p>
            <ul>
              <li>We, the creative class, could embarrass the industries of war
                by humanitarian licensing, such this humanitarian agpl;</li>
              <li>The Humanitarian agpl (hagpl), as any other Humanitarian open
                source (hos) code, puts the 5th criteria, "No Discrimination
                Against Persons or Groups", a condition for the 6th one, "No
                Discrimination Against Fields of Endeavor" and hence forbids any
                discrimination between people by the use of such code.</li>
              <li>The <em>knife-tank killing case</em>: a non-humanitarian,
                usual and repeated argument tells that the use of knife is dual,
                for buttering - a humanitarian one, but also a non humanitarian
                use to kill people, but the case of (the vehicle) tank having in
                its specification being better in killing people is not "also
                humanitarian" as putting butter on the bread. Thus, in
                developing a humanitarian code from such knife, the tank
                application would already become forbidden.</li>
              <li><em>Stopping wars cannot be made by constantly adding wars</em>,
                but by fighting the industry producing its weapons, an industry
                which must have all unique things under its control, a condition
                which is fully dependent on any one's creativity, a case which
                developing under humanitarian code can prevent.</li>
              <li><em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Josef_Mengele">Josef
                    Mengele</a> ones, please stop hacking people</em>: Arguments
                putting the freedom to learn by doing and the add to knowledge
                above any other values can only be accepted as Pseudo Religious
                by Agents or Angels of Death, especially nowadays, when in
                larger areas machines are able to be more competitive than
                human.</li>
              <li>Humanitarian open source can at-least embarrass or become more
                costly for the NSA in its Unnecessary and Disproportionate habit
                to Violates International Human Rights Standards.</li>
              <li><strong>Dual licensing option:</strong> "If you hold the
                humanitarian values specified above and only when the code
                contains agpl compatible licensed code, you may use this code
                under agpl".</li>
            </ul>
            <p style="text-align: center;">At any rate, licensed gpl versus
              agpl, is anachronism allowing closing open source in servers farms
              providing dark services.</p>
