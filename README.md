# edensgarden
The hopeisback [branch](https://github.com/comcomist/edensgarden) is made only for cloned pull requests from here. This makes the official version be in control of comcomist@github, acting as a regulator that can force rules, roles and tests, before publishing, while that process is fully transparent.

# How this site is made
* This git belongs to group of [members](https://github.com/orgs/hopeisback/people), of which each is a github user acting as admin of one or more groups.
* The data of each group is public and seats in different directory of the git.
* Each admin has a local copy of all the git and all admins are listening to any of the git's changes. 
* The name of each group has more than 2 characters, while other directory names are reserved for our key/code words.
* In each directory the collapsible index.html is able to contain nicely a lot of searchable and referable information without context lost while being translated to any language in another index file having its proper extension.
